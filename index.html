    <h1>Sass:syntactically awesome style sheets</h1>
    <pre>
        Sass is a CSS pre-processor.
        Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.
    </pre>
    <h1>What is Sass</h1>
    <pre>
        Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
        Sass is an extension to CSS
        Sass is a CSS pre-processor
        Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
        Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
    </pre>

    <h1>Why Use Sass?</h1>
    <pre>
        Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

        Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance,
        built-in functions.

    </pre>

    <h1>How Does Sass Work?</h1>
    <pre>
        A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

        This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.
    </pre>

    <h1>Sass Variables</h1>
    <pre>
    Variables are a way to store information that you can re-use later.

    With Sass, you can store information in variables, like:

    strings
    numbers
    colors
    booleans
    lists
    nulls
    Sass uses the $ symbol, followed by a name, to declare variables:
  </pre
    >

    <h1 class="variable-scope">Sass Variable Scope</h1>
    <pre>
    Sass variables are only available at the level of nesting where they are defined.
  </pre
    >

    <h1 class="scope-test">Test variable close</h1>

    <h1 class="test-global">Using Sass !global</h1>
    <pre class="global">
        The default behavior for variable scope can be overridden by using the !global switch.

        !global indicates that a variable is global, which means that it is accessible on all levels.
    </pre>

    <h1>Sass Nested Rules and Properties</h1>
    <pre>
Sass lets you nest CSS selectors in the same way as HTML.

    </pre>

    <nav class="navagation">
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JS</li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

    <h1>Sass Nested Properties</h1>

    <pre>
        Many CSS properties have the same prefix, like font-family, font-size and font-weight or text-align, 
        text-transform and text-overflow.
    </pre>

    <h1>Sass @import and Partials</h1>

    <pre>
        Sass keeps the CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). One way to write DRY code is to keep related code in separate files.

        You can create small files with CSS snippets to include in other Sass files.
         Examples of such files can be: reset file, variables, colors, fonts, font-sizes, etc.      
    </pre>

    <h1 class="import_class">Sass Importing Files</h1>
    <pre>
        Just like CSS, Sass also supports the @import directive.

        The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

        The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra 
        HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Sass @import directive includes the file in the CSS;
        so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!
    </pre>

    <h1>Sass Partials</h1>
    <pre>
        By default, Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, 
        you do not need the file to be transpiled directly.

        Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it.
        Files named this way are called partials in Sass.

        So, a partial Sass file is named with a leading underscore:
    </pre>

    <h1 class="mixin_prop">Sass @mixin and @include</h1>
    <pre>
        The @mixin directive lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the website.

        The @include directive is created to let you use (include) the mixin.
    </pre>

    <h1 class="passing_variable">Passing Variables to a Mixin</h1>
    <pre>
Mixins accept arguments. This way you can pass variables to a mixin.</pre
    >

    <h1 class="default_value">Default Values for a Mixin</h1>
    <pre>
It is also possible to define default values for mixin variables:

    </pre>

    <h1>Sass @extend Directive</h1>
    <pre>
      The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.

      The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small details.

      
    </pre>
    <button class="button_basic">Basic</button>
    <button class="button_report">Report</button>
    <button class="button_submit">Submit</button>
  </body>
